Ripple Bounty Program Guidelines
================================
We're pleased to offer bounties for projects that we deem valuable for the advancement of the Ripple project. Here are some things to keep in mind if you'd like to participate:

1. All bounties will be denominated in XRP

2. Anyone can propose a bounty
    * This is done by opening an issue on the relevant Github repository
    * Bounty proposers must be willing to pay the amount themselves by backing the bounty on Bountysource
    * Ripple Labs will not mediate disputes between community members
    * Only pursue bounties where you trust the proposerâ€™s ability to pay

3. Multiple people can pursue a bounty, but XRP will only be granted to the first approved solution
    * Solutions will be reviewed based upon the order of submission
        * Order of submission is determined by the timestamp of the pull request

4. You must declare your intent to pursue a bounty
    * This is done by commenting "I GOT THIS" on the issue on Github and emailing [developers@ripple.com](mailto:developers@ripple.com) with the bounty title in the subject line
        * For open-ended bounties where you can choose what to build, be specific about what you're working on
        * The Ripple Labs team will be updating the [master spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/ripple.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsgbH9O58AlmdEs0ZFlmbmRMLXFVTElzQ3VqRl9nWUE&usp=drive_web#gid=0) with bounty participants on a daily basis

5. Bounties may have sub-bounties
    * Larger, complex projects may benefit from being broken into sub-bounties
    * These will be broken down into multiple issues in the projects Github repository
    * The master bounty total must be equivalent to the sum of the amounts offered for the sub-bounties

6. Bounties are considered complete when the code has been merged or forked on github and made public
    * Bounties involving code submission to a repo under [https://github.com/ripple](https://github.com/ripple) will be reviewed, vetted, and approved by a member of the Ripple Labs team
        * Bounties involving code submission to any non-Ripple repo will be reviewed, vetted and approved by the bounty proposer or a community member designated by the proposer

7. Bounties can be in one of three states:
    * ACTIVE
        * Anyone can declare their intent to pursue the bounty and begin work
    * SOLUTION IN REVIEW
        * Pull request has been submitted for review, but is not yet reviewed and merged
    * COMPLETE
        * Pull request has been accepted and merged
8. All code submissions must be made under an [ISC license](http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)
